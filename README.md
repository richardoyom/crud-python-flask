# crud-python-flask

 In this project, I created a Products's list using a Flask server. The application allows you to add a product,
 retrieve the products, retrieve a specific product with its id, update a specific product with its id, and delete a product with its id. All
 these operations were achieved through the REST API endpoints in your Flask server.
 I created an application with API endpoints to perform Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete operations on the above data
 using a Flask server.
 I used cURL and POSTMAN to test the implemented endpoints.
